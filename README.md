Abstract: *The ability to detect when medical imaging segmentation models have per-formed poorly is crucial for their deployment in clinical settings. While methods such as Monte-Carlo dropout and ensembling perform well, they require modifications to the training scheme and are expensive at inference. The current work predicts inadequate performance using the segmentation modelâ€™s features, requiring no training scheme modifications, and incurring minimal cost. Mahalanobis distance, Gram matrices, and spectral analysis were applied to dimensionality-reduced features extracted from all encoding layers of 3 segmentation architectures (nnU-net, Swin Transformer, 3D U-net) trained on 10 segmentation datasets (Medical Segmentation Decathlon).*
