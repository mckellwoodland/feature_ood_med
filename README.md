**Feature-based Out-of-Distribution Detection for Medical Imaging Segmentation**

Abstract: *The ability to detect when medical imaging segmentation models have performed poorly is crucial for their deployment in clinical settings. While methods such as MC dropout and ensembling perform well, they require modifications to the training scheme and are expensive at inference. The current work predicts inadequate performance using the segmentation modelâ€™s features, requiring no training scheme modifications, and incurring minimal cost. Mahalanobis distance, Gram matrices, and spectral analysis were applied to dimensionality-reduced features extracted from all encoding layers of 3 segmentation architectures (nnU-net, Swin Transformer, 3D U-net) trained on 10 segmentation datasets (MSD).*
